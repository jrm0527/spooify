# Front End Capstone: Spotify Clone

The requirement of this project was to build a copy of a page from Spotify.  The UI should have as much operation as needed to function properly for that page . In addition to having the same look and feel of the original. While working in a larger grup we all needed to handle atleast one component of the site setup.  We also had to use RESTful API calls and use REACT as a basis for building the site.To get full functionality from our site you will need to have a Spotify premium account.

- return to the root folder
- repeat the serve steps for the client folder

```bash

- From there add this to your .env   
- Run Docker container and copy the seed and migration files to the /tmp folder created by docker.
- run postgreSQL through VS Code
- create a Database to hold all the data
- initialize the migration and seed file into the database created

```bash
  docker exec -it (docker container ID) bash
  psql -U postgres
  CREATE DATABASE (database name);
  \c (database name)
  \i /tmp/migration.sql
  \i /tmp/seed.sql
```
- from here cd into the server folder
- run the database using nodemon index.js
- to run the client side just run npm run dev to get the client side up and running.
